 </head>

 <body>
    I am Nabil Huseni and I am currently a sophomore studying Finance and Information Management and Technology at Syracuse University. I’m interested in exploring the intersection of business and technology through strategy consulting or product management. Some accomplishments include a summer internship and dean’s list. Outside of school and work, my hobbies include fitness, trying new foods, watching college sports, and spending time with friends.
