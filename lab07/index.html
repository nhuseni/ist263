    <p>
      I am Nabil Huseni and I am currently a sophomore studying Finance and 
      Information Management and Technology at Syracuse University. I’m interested 
      in exploring the intersection of business and technology through strategy 
      consulting or product management. Some accomplishments include a summer 
      internship and dean’s list. Outside of school and work, my hobbies include 
      fitness, trying new foods, watching college sports, and spending time with 
      friends.
